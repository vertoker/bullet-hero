* Change seekable packet reading to return the packet instance prior to reading continuations
	- This will reduce memory usage and will improve latency for continued packets

* Support Skeleton metadata
	- This would be processed entirely within ContainerReader and owned references

* RTP support
	- This would be a new IPacketProvider implementation

* Matroska support
	- Needs a base EBML reader

* Test with a lot more Vorbis streams
